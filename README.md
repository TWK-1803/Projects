# Projects

This is a collection of the various projects and other small things I have made on my own time. Most were just made for fun or to mess with something I thought was interesting, so they aren't the most complete things I've ever built. All that to say, these aren't really intended to be very user-friendly or interactive where they don't have to be, so handle at your own risk. Where more than just running a file directly is required, instructions will be provided.

## 24

I played a game when I was younger where you roll 4 dice and try to apply mathematical operations to the numbers you rolled in any order needed to reach the number 24 without changing any of the numbers directly. For example: 1,4,5,6 can reach 24 with 4/(1-5/6). Originally, all that was allowed was +, -, *, /, and (), but there were a few notable cases where the number you rolled could genuinely be unsolvable. This led to adding factorials into the mix once I was old enough to understand them. At some point in college, I proved that just using +, -, *, /, (), and ! was enough to make every possible roll of 4 6-sided dice possible (By exhaustively solving them all by hand as would a true math genius).

Recently, I happened across a program in Haskell that generated these automatically and thought to take a crack at doing that myself. 24_Haskython is the result of my eyeballing the Haskell program (I don't know Haskell... at all) and trying to transpose it into python (failing miserably until things started to line up, apologies for the weirdness). While my truly awful code does tell you what IS possible to solve, it doesnt tell you HOW. 24_Python is something I wrote to automatically make those formulas instead of just spitting out true or false. It definitely isn't as complete or exhaustive as the first attempt, but it solves my specific use case fine.

## BF Interpreter

I was speaking with a coworker one day and we came upon the topic of esoteric languages and the many ways in which they can be uniquely terrible and funny. This led me to me describing BrainFuck (BF), explaining its lovely personal brand of awfulness, and both of us being interested in seeing it in action. At the time, I was looking into compilers and interpreters and figured this would be a nice, relaxing place to wade into that topic programmatically. 

BFInterpreter is exactly what it says, just feed a text file in with a .bf file extension and it will crunch right through it. Just keep in mind that this isn't meant to help you actually write in BF and will happily allow you to run a program that doesn't terminate or output anything. BFToPF is just a program that converts .bf files to a visual representation using RBG values. I read about it when looking at the esoteric languages Wiki and thought it would be funny to implement. Some specifics on my interpeter: memory is a tape of 30000 looping cells, values cannot go below 0 and do not overflow to the maximum, and calling input when there is none will store a 0

Both files are invoked with "python '*python file*' '*.bf file*'"

## Connect 4

The Connect 4 programs were created because I wanted to play with minimaxxing and alpha-beta pruning, and was then prompted to see what I could do to throw a visual component on top. I might come back to this with an attempt to make an agent using ML sometime in the future seeing as I've started to get a better understanding of them.

Put Connect4AIAgent, Connect4Window, and Gameboard in the same directory and run Connect4Window to see the project as it was originally presented. All it does it put together a specific kind of Gameboard instance and setup the minimaxxing algorithm and display it. You will need pygame installed for this. If you want to use the Gameboard class for another game, you will have to create an instance of it for yourself in your code as it will not run on its own.

## Game of Life

When I first started programming I was told to try and make Conway's Game of Life as it's simple to understand and, in theory, implement. Unfortunately for me, I was not good enough yet to really understand how to do much of what I do now and thus failed miserably. I recently started going through some old projects of mine and remembered my last attempt at this. What you see is the result of 2 days of thoroughly dunking on my past self for his lack of skill.

Put both files in the same folder and run GameOfLifeVisual to run this.

## Graphics

These programs come from a class I took on building 3D graphics from scratch in college. They are entirely seperate programs and can be run individually to see the various stages of creation as the project progressed. While I am not entirely happy with how they turned out and could certainly make them so much cleaner and faster knowing what I do now, I thought it was worth archiving as they were part of the most involved and interesting project I undertook at school.

In order of development: Wireframe, InPlaceManipulation, PolygonShading, ShadingModels

## ImgToAscii

As much as I like diving down random rabbit holes as my interests change, sometimes its good to have one of those holes thing be over and done with in a matter of an hour or two rather than the days I spend on other projects. This little thing was inspired, oddly enough, by the works of Petros Vrellis. I played with his techniques and the math behind them for a little while before I decided to see what other stuff mught be done to produce an image out of something other than pixels or colors. Eventually, I came across ascii art and put together this program to make some. Normally, I wouldn't put the scripts or other small experiments I write in this repo but the results were too cool looking not to.

The other program is just a slightly code golfed version of the original. A coworker of mine has an interest in code golfing so I thought I'd give it a try myself. Honestly, I kind of enjoy it. Gives me a reason to scratch that optimization itch in my personal projects (As if I don't get enough of that in my actual work). I usually don't bother because these are more about me exploring topics that I take an interest in or just archiving, so unless optimization is the express purpose of the program, having it work as expected and not take 3.x billion years is usually enough for me.

For ImgToAscii just provide an image with "python ImgToAscii.py *image file*". for the code golfed version, the file need to be supplied in the program itself.

## Marching Squares

I was inspired to look into marching cubes by Sebastian Lague's video on the topic, but I decided that my usual GUI approach wasn't going to work very well with 3D without doing a lot of work on a topic I'd already played with (see my graphics projects). Seeing as I was more interested in just getting my hands dirty and not reinventing the graphics wheel for the 1000th time (the classic thing programmers love to do for no reason... I'm not a hypocrite on that at all), I went for marching squares in 2D instead. Same concept, slightly easier math - an absolutely massive plus for me. While I was looking into the subject, I came across ray marching and signed distance functions, so maybe I'll go look at that if I ever come back around to this sort of area of study.

Seeing as I made this after making (stealing) my WFC program I figured a config file might be a nice idea. The Square and Circle files just contain the required code to get collision detection, movement, and implicit functions working for those specific shapes so that the actual driving program could be a lot more abstract. Technically, this approach works for any implicit function provided it has a way to be updated (even if that does nothing) and a way to return a value for the implicit function that describes it when handed a 2D point, but finding implicit functions for other polygons like triangles can be a lot more complicated than I'd like so the 2 shapes in this project are all I added.

Place all the files in the same directory and run MarchingSquaresVisual to get it going. Theres much less configuration on the fly than my other projects since a lot of it needed to be done up front and be immutable, sorry about that. Feel free to add your own shapes and see how they react

## Splines

I often find myself in the mood to just build things and see if I can make it work, and it was on one such occasion that I stumbled across De Casteljau's algorithm. I've never been one for pure math, so the visual aspect of what this algorithm described so beautifully interested me greatly. This led to a rabbit hole of video games, animation, vector graphics, and all sorts of other applications. Ultimately, I ended up implementing the BezierCurve file you see and liked how it looked so much I decided to see what else this thing could do. 

BezierSplines are just multiple curves stapled together, HermiteSplines use vectors to define tangents at the control points, but they secretly can be defined by specific implementations of BezierCurves, CardinalSplines are much the same except the vectors are automatically defined, and CatmullRomSplines are just a specific kind of CardinalSpline. All of this from one simple little algorithm... except LinearSplines. Those were just too funny to leave out.

Keep all the files in the same directory and run SplinesVisual for this one, and feel free to mess with the definitions of the splines individually.

## The Chaos Game

I mostly uploaded this just because it was the first project I did at college and it looks cool. No real other reason. Just enjoyed making it and thought to archive it.

## TicTacToe

This program came out of a truly idiotic conversation where I and some coworkers were dicussing the idea that you could make anything if you just wrote enough if statements. Naturally, I wanted to see how far you could push that idea while still making something 'useful' and thus was this stupid thing created. The idea is that it pulls a list of possible boardstates (which I created manually) and the best possible move to make if it appears (which I also did manually) from a text file. It then stores that data and references it when needed instead of running fancy algoithms or any of that other smart nonsense. Not quite the if statement glory it could have been, but the idea is there. If this boardstate, then this move.

You will need both files in the same folder, or to change the filepath if you run TicTacToe as is. Alternatively, you can implement the class and give it your own dictionary in the format of the original txt file.

## WFC

I first encountered the wave function collapse algorithm through the games of Oskar Stålberg. I was interested to see how the level generation was done and came across a youtube video explaining WFC by Martin Donald and wanted to play with it myself. Since I was more interested in just having something to play with and not with spending many hours of my life fine tuning a tileset, I semi took the approach that the original implementation did and decided to allow it to generate its own rules and constrains based on an example image. Most of this code is taken from https://github.com/CodingQuest2023/Algorithms/tree/main/WorldGeneration/WaveFunctionCollapse so I could get things up and running quickly... I don't want to imagine the amount of wrangling I'd have to do to get this working in Tkinter like some of my other projects that have a GUI component. The parts that allow for generation of the rules and such as well as the edits I made to fit those rules in the actually algorithm are my only real contribution here.

Some notes on the program in general: WFC works best when the number of ways to fail is very low, so try to provide examples with a relatively low number of unique tiles while still displaying a lot of possible permutations they can appear in. This program does recognize structures that take up more than 1 tile, but those structures have to be internally consistent and may make failure more likely. The rules are not stored as sockets but as pure references to what tiles can go where which can make failure rates higher if the example doesn't match well with the kind that works best.

Config.py allows for some tweaking of the ouput, and it is where the path to the example image is specified. Make sure all python files are in the same directory and run WFC.py to get it working.
