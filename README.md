# Projects
This is a collection of the various projects and similar such things
I have made throughout school and on my own time.

Notes on how to run the programs:

The Chaos Game will run with no additional requirements.

Wireframe will run with no additional requirements.

InPlaceManipulationOfWireFrame will run with no additional requirements.

PolygonShadingWithZBuffer will run with no additional requirements.

ShadingModels will run with no additional requirements.

Connect4Window uses an instance of Connect4AIAgent and the pygame library to run, both are require to play a game against the Agent. Running 
Connect4Window on the command line will start a game.

Gameboard allows for custom boards to be generated and played with a specified number of players, but it is not intended to work with the agent.
It will not run as a python script. This is a class intended to be implemented into other code.

TicTacToeGame works by loading the provided move dictionary text file, so both are required to run it. The dictionary can be edited to edit the behavior.
